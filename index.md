## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by Prof. [Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/). My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, especially human pose estimation. I achieved my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Previsouly, I worked with Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/)@SJTU and Prof. [Guosheng Lin](https://guosheng.github.io/)@NTU.


<!-- ## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
